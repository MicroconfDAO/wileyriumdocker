# wileyriumdocker

run.sh removes docker image (if exist)  
creates new docker image, 
starts it, 
runs entrypoint.sh

entrypoint.sh make all operations (doesn't work, probably FROM image need to use ubuntu)


mailer.js for email sending npm run mail -- to@to.to text should be included in entrypoint.sh
